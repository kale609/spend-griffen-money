## Spend Kenny G's Money  

This is just a simple website built with React where you can pretty much see how much stuff you can buy using Kenny G's net worth (the hedge fund guy not the musician).
Okay, okay, I get it, you might be thinking: "Aight, but what's the point of this?" **None**; there's no point. I was just bored and said: "You know what? Let's build this 'cuz why not?"
